I am a final-year Engineering Science undergraduate at the University of Toronto, specializing in Robotics Engineering. I have had the privilege of working with **[Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/)**, **[Daniel Wigdor](https://danielwigdor.com)**, **[Ervin SejdiÄ‡](http://imedlab.org/people/principal-investigator/)**, and **[Steven Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/steven-waslander)** on various research projects.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">I am actively seeking a PhD position in Computer Vision & Robotics in North America for Fall 2026!</span>

Research Interest
======
My research spans **computer vision, robotics, and machine learning**, with a focus on developing systems that bridge **visual understanding and real-world interaction**. I am particularly interested in enabling machines to see, reason, and act in complex environments.

Beyond Research
======
Beyond research, I am the co-founder of **SkyFlow Robotics**, a startup developing **autonomous drone and robotic platforms** for precision agriculture and turf management. My work integrates fundamental AI methods with applied robotics, with the goal of creating systems that are scientifically rigorous, socially impactful, and practically deployable.

Fun Fact
======
I enjoy spending time with my boy Kuma, a playful **Alaskan Malamute** who is turning two years old.
